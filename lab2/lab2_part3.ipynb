    "# **Lab 2 - Part 3 - Spark**\n",
    "#### This lab will demonstrate how to perform web server log analysis with Spark. Log data is a very large, common data source and contains a rich set of information.  It comes from many sources, such as web, file, and compute servers, application logs, user-generated content,  and can be used for monitoring servers, improving business and customer intelligence, building recommendation systems, fraud detection, and much more. This lab will show you how to use Spark on real-world text-based production logs and fully harness the power of that data."

    "The log files that we use for this assignment are in the [Apache Common Log Format (CLF)](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html#common). The log file entries produced in CLF will look something like this:\n",
    "`127.0.0.1 - - [01/Aug/1995:00:00:01 -0400] \"GET /images/launch-logo.gif HTTP/1.0\" 200 1839`\n",
    " \n",
    "Each part of this log entry is described below:\n",
    "* **`127.0.0.1`:** this is the IP address (or host name, if available) of the client (remote host) which made the request to the server. \n",
    "* **`-`:** the \"hyphen\" in the output indicates that the requested piece of information (user identity from remote machine) is not available.\n",
    "* **`-`:** the \"hyphen\" in the output indicates that the requested piece of information (user identity from local logon) is not available. \n",
    "* **`[01/Aug/1995:00:00:01 -0400]`:** the time that the server finished processing the request. The format is:\n",
    "`[day/month/year:hour:minute:second timezone]`.\n",
    "* **`\"GET /images/launch-logo.gif HTTP/1.0\"`:** this is the first line of the request string from the client. It consists of a three components: the request method (e.g., `GET`, `POST`, etc.), the endpoint, and the client protocol version. \n",
    "* **`200`:** this is the status code that the server sends back to the client. This information is very valuable, because it reveals whether the request resulted in a successful response (codes beginning in 2), a redirection (codes beginning in 3), an error caused by the client (codes beginning in 4), or an error in the server (codes beginning in 5). The full list of possible status codes can be found in the HTTP specification ([RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) section 10).\n",
    "* **`1839`:** the last entry indicates the size of the object returned to the client, not including the response headers. If no content was returned to the client, this value will be \"-\" (or sometimes 0).\n",
    " \n",
    "Using the CLF as defined above, we create a regular expression pattern to extract the nine fields of the log line. The function returns a pair consisting of a Row object and 1. If the log line fails to match the regular expression, the function returns a pair consisting of the log line string and 0. A '-' value in the content size field is cleaned up by substituting it with 0. The function converts the log line's date string into a Python `datetime` object using the given `parse_apache_time` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "We, then, create the primary RDD and  we'll use in the rest of this assignment. We first load the text file and convert each line of the file into an element in an RDD. Next, we use `map(parseApacheLogLine)` to apply the parse function to each element and turn each line into a pair `Row` object. Finally, we cache the RDD in memory since we'll use it throughout this notebook. The log file is available at `data/apache/apache.log`."

We can compute the statistics by applying a `map` to the `access_logs` RDD. The *lambda* function we want for the map is to extract the `content_size` field from the RDD. The map produces a new RDD containing only the `content_sizes` (one element for each `Row` object in the `access_logs` RDD). To compute the minimum and maximum statistics, we can use `min()` and `max()` functions on the new RDD. We can compute the average statistic by using the `reduce` function with a *lambda* function that sums the two inputs, which represent two elements from the new RDD that are being reduced together. The result of the `reduce()` is the total content size from the log and it is to be divided by the number of requests as determined using the `count()` function on the new RDD."

The difference here is that we will use a \"pair tuple\" instead of just the field itself. Using a pair tuple consisting of the response code and 1 will let us count how many records have a particular response code. Using the new RDD, we perform a `reduceByKey` function. `reduceByKey` performs a reduce on a per-key basis by applying the *lambda* function to each element, pairwise with the same key.
